##My first hackathon:
Hourglass Redux is a fast-paced platformer where two players race to retrieve a key and unlock the next level. Designed with the Phaser game framework, Hourglass implements Redux to manage state across multiple clients. Local state is continuously updated via Phaser, while global updates are emitted to and from the server at regular intervals. To add an element of surprise to the game, players can spend coins to rewind their opponents state and undo time.

Built with: Phaser.io, Redux, socket.io, Express.js
